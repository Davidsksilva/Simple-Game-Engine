# Simple Render Engine

A Simple 3D Game Engine under development, using OpenGL, ImGui and GLFW.

## Getting Started

Now we are going to see how to set up and run the engine. Tested only on Ubuntu 18.04 64 bits.

### Dependencies

Before running the program, we need to download and install some dependencies:

**Glew**
```
sudo apt-get install libXmu-dev libXi-dev libgl-dev dos2unix git wget
```

**GLFW**
```
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
```

### Running

To run the program, ``make`` on the root folder.

On the root folder:

```
make
```

Then:

```
./run
```

## Built With

* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - API for computer graphics
* [Glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) - Extention loading library for OpenGL
